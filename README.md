# python-algoritms
A collection of common algorithms in Python.

## Purpose
This repository contains a collection of common algorithms written in the Python programming language. Each algorithm is placed in a separate file with an accompanying simple test and an account of the alogorithms O(n) runtime. Many of these algorithms form the foundation of modern programming, appearing on whiteboard interviews and in common coding exercises. They introduce common concepts like iteration, recursion, the stack, hash tables, and more. Pull requests and style enhacements are encouraged.

## Running the Examples
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/parkerziegler/python-algorithms.git
cd python-algorithms
```

Run an example:
```
python binarySearch.py
```

## Python 2 and 3
Currently, all samples in this project are written in Python 2. Adding Python 3 versions of these algorithms will be a future goal of this project.

## Acknowledgements
Many of these examples were modified from [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) by Aditya Bhargava. If you're curious to better understand how these algorithms work, please support the author by purchasing the book or requesting it from your local library.
